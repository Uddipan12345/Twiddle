Project Description

The Twitter-like project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of Twitter. It consists of three pages:

Main Page: This page serves as the landing page for the project. It provides an introduction or overview of the project, along with any necessary instructions or call-to-action.

Login Page: The login page enables users to authenticate themselves by entering their username and password. It validates the entered credentials before granting access to the news feed page.

News Feed Page: Once authenticated, users are directed to the news feed page. This page displays posts from various users and allows users to post their own content. Additionally, it incorporates a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes, providing a personalized user experience.
